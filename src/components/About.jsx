           <span className="font-bold text-xl text-teal-900">SIMPLICITY IN DESIGN</span> <br /> No flashy logos. No senseless details. Just the
          world's most comfortable shoes, made naturally and designed
          practically. It's that simple.

          <span className="font-bold text-xl text-teal-900">CONFIDENCE IN COMFORT</span>  <br />Trying is believing. Give our shoes a shot for
          30 days, and if you're not walking on cloud nine, we'll take them
          backâ€”no questions asked.

          <span className="font-bold text-xl text-teal-900">MADE FROM NATURE </span><br />The footwear industry often overlooks Mother Nature's
          materials in favor of cheaper, synthetic alternatives. We think it's
          time to change that.
